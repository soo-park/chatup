# DoorDash Frontend Interview Project: Time: *3-6hrs*

Thank you for reviewing my project. The project was built to apply for the Front-end enginner at Doordash. The front-end was built from scratch without any automated tools. The object was NOT to show a new and complete product, but to show skill sets.
